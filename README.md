# Naval_Battle

The aim of the project is to create a naval battle against the computer, so that a player can play against it.

## Installation

There's no need to install anything, just launch the program and it will run automatically.

## Use

My project is easy to use, as indicated on the Makefile, you just have to launch the program. I've run into a problem with my Place_Boats function, which causes a segmentation fault, but I can't resolve the error despite several attempts at debugging. At the end of the first run, just after the computer has been played, the program stops. I've put all my functions here, in the hope that you'll find them useful.
